Recently another researcher contacted me after reading an old article of mine comparing [virtual ethnography, Netnography, & digital sociology](https://naiyanjones.com/reddit/research-frameworks-ethnograhpy-netnography-sociology/) from the perspectives of a research framewors. I was asked for some clarification about Netnography and what I termed 'virtual ethnography'

> I have the feeling that Netnography is a more specific and detailed online ethnography, am I right? 

In a word, yes. 

[Kozinet himself](https://kozinets.net/archives/475 ) differentiates Netnography from ethnography because he says his approach is structured and carried out within a framework. He compares this to online ethnography which is a more general term for a set of different umbrella approaches. He goes on and says:

>  Netnography refers to a specific set of online ethnographic procedures characterized by a particular methodology, including an epistemological background, analytic frameworks, and a consistent and evolving set of guidelines for entree, observation, data analysis, ethics, and so on.

For further discussions on Netnography as a framework, approach and use in studies I would recommend reading how it has been used in health research ([Rashin et al, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1609406915621421)), marketing ([Bartl et al, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1504/IJTMKT.2016.075687)) and in the International Journal of Qualitative Methods ([Costello et al, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1609406917700647)).

Lastly if you have access to a university/institutional library I would strongly suggest picking up a copy of Kozinet's third edition book on *Netnography* and Christine Hine's *Ethnography for the Internet* to compare yourself. Kozinet refers to Hine several times throughout this book and is helpfully cited in the back-Index pages.
