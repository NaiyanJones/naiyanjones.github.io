In November 2020 last year I officially joined the Alabama Reddit Research Group (ARRG) headed by Dr Elliot Panek.

The [Alabama Reddit Research Group]( https://arrg.ua.edu/) (ARRG) is dedicated to improving the understanding of social dynamics and impact of Reddit. The group team develops, tests, and implements tools for analysing group and individual behaviour on Reddit as well as characteristics of Reddit's discourse. They have used tools to study a variety of outcomes, including health outcomes, civility in public discourse, and social dynamics in large groups over time.

I am joining good company including my current collaborators Dr Professor Britt and Courtny Franco who I am working with on a [meta-analysis of Reddit health studies](https://naiyanjones.com/reddit/meta-analysis-of-health-studies-on-Reddit/) and look forward to further research and collaborations.
