 It's nearly exactly 4 years [since I made this website](https://naiyanjones.com/technology/how-i-built-this-website/), and since then I've both have a fulfiling and fun career at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and a few of the stuff I used to update this website got [depreciated](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/). 
  
 So recently I've switched to using [Microsft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ("VSCode") to write my blog posts and formatting in Markdown. Which is a bit funny as I somwtimes to use VSCode for research and analysis at work nowadays.

 Expect a few updates on the website as I revamp it, and also several posts and musing surveys and social media.
