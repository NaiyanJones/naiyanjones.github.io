Over the past several months I've paused on writing about Reddit because of personal and professional reasons. This is an update on that, next steps and overall goals on my [literature review](http://naiyanjones.com/reddit/systematized-literature-review-of-reddit/), [previous work](http://naiyanjones.com/politics/british-politicians-amas-reddit-thematic-analysis/) and potential future work.

### The personal

I thoroughly enjoyed my master's at Birmingham and everything I learned. But in the end, I decided not to continue with a PhD due to mental health concerns. In addition my father suffered a heart attack at the start of 2020. Being near family and supporting him is more important to me.

### Switching to Zotero

In the process of winding down from my postgraduate I wanted to keep my references for, well, reference and further reading. I decided to switch to [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) from RefWorks given it was free and open source. In the transfer process a lot of my references were corrupted. Now during lockdown with a lot of time on my hands I'm slowly building my database back again and manually reviewing that the citations are correct. All 700 plus of them. Fun.

### Onwards research!

In all respects I could have stopped and not bothered continuing with this research. Why didn't I?

Firstly, and honestly, I still find Reddit and studies on or involving it fascinating. [There's such a diversity of articles and papers](http://naiyanjones.com/reddit/reddit-and-academic-research/). Of disciplines. Approaches. Research interests and phenomena studied. There's definitely enough to keep me interested.

Secondly, I have time on my hands during lockdown and being under-employed. There's only so much time you can waste on your laptop. Time do something more productive. From leaning R and Python for future projects, to [building this webiste](http://naiyanjones.com/personal/how-i-built-this-website/), and "finishing" my Reddit search.

Lastly, to be a bit brazen, I believe it's a good thing to give back to Social Scienceâ„¢. Over the months I've had researchers and students reach out to me. From early years researchers, tenured and professors. From undergraduate and postgraduate students. And helping someone gives me a nice warm fuzzy feeling. Call it a bit of altruism. Or for the cyncial econonomists, a bit of self-interest for getting that feel good factor.

### Next steps and goals

My next steps in vague order:

1. Review all existing Reddit references and correct on Zotero if need be.
2. Add new studies from April 2020 onwards.
3. Write and publish a new blog post on the results.
4. Continue drafting a literature review and upload to a pre-print repository like [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) or [SSRN](https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/).
5. Update and post on [/r/AcademicReddit]( https://reddit.com/r/AcademicReddit/) as a form of public outreach and easy online Reddit study aggregator.
6. Provide a bibliographic website page similar to Danah Boyd's [Bibliography of Research on Social Network Sites](http://www.danah.org/researchBibs/sns.php).
7. Get feedback from my academic network before submitting to a journal.
8. Publish a list of referenced works so it's easy to browse through by any researcher not matter the skill level - either in a standalone interactive website, Google Sheets, etc.
