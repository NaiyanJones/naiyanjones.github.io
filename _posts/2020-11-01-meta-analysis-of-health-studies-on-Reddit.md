Starting in October 2020 I will be researching, writing and co-authoring a meta-analysis of Reddit health studies.

There are many health studies which have used Reddit data to investigate different topics. These have ranged from health topics like depression, experiences of patients, urology issues and experiences of neo-natal care. And most recently discourse around Covid-19.

A meta-analysis is a statistical analysis of separate studies which is able to combine results to gain further insights. Through this analysis we will identify the strengths of interventions, synthesise evidence and the literature, and highlight method and research topic gaps.

This study is in collaboration with [Dr Rebecca Britt](https://rebeccakbritt.com/) from the University of Alabama who specialises in health communications and is part of the [Alabama Reddit Research Group](https://arrg.ua.edu/).
