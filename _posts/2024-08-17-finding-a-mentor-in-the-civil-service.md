Finding a mentor in the civil service can be a great development experience and a boost to your career. Here’s a few things to consider when trying to find a mentor.

To start with you need to solidly reflect what you want out of a mentorship. This is so important as it means both you and your mentor do not waste each other’s time. It also builds trust and credibility between both of you. 

##Your immediate colleagues

Start by looking within your immediate network. Your colleagues can be a great source of mentorship. They understand the specific challenges and opportunities within your department and can provide relevant advice. 

##Reach to other colleagues within your department

Don’t hesitate to reach out to people in your department who you admire or who have the experience you seek. A direct approach, such as sending an email or requesting a meeting, can be effective. Be clear about why you are seeking their mentorship and what you hope to learn from them.

##Formal programmes in your department

Many departments offer formal mentoring programmes. These programmes are designed to match mentors with mentees based on their goals and interests. Check with your Intranet, people services (rebranded human resources), or ask your manager to see what programmes are available and how you can participate.

##Cross-government formal programmes

Consider participating in cross-government formal programmes, such as Catapult or Breaking Boundaries. These initiatives are specifically designed to foster mentorship across different government departments.

##Cross-government groups or networks

There are some pretty nifty [cross-government networks out there](https://www.civil-service-careers.gov.uk/civil-service-networks/). Ranging from those who have [disabilities, faith and belief, are carers, or LGBT+](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-staff-networks). You can inquire if any have any formal mentorship opportunities or reach out to colleagues in these networks.

##Expect a few refusals
Finally, be open to the process but prepared for a few refusals. Learning how to face rejection professionally is a great learning opportunity. A lot of people will be flattered to be asked, but also won’t have much time to engage. This is pretty normal.
