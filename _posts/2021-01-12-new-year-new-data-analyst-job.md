In January 2021 I'm happy to say I started a new job as a data analyst for the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The ONS is the UK’s largest independent producer of official statistics and its recognised national statistical institute. They are responsible for collecting and publishing statistics related to the economy, population and society at national, regional and local levels. And they also conduct the census in England and Wales every 10 years with the newest census starting in March 2021.

This is a great opportunity to get really stuck into research as a career and I'm looking forward to it!

At the same time I will be balancing and continuing my work with the Alabama Reddit Research Group. Luckily because of time zone differences I am able to fit in nearly all of my academic work in the evening after my job in the ONS.
