Broadly speaking there's two big project management (PM) qualifications you'll come across in the Civil Service. Warning: it's a bit of an acronym word salad.

You have the [Association of Project Management](https://www.apm.org.uk/) (APM) who have the APM Project Management Qualification (PMQ) which tends to be shorter and cheaper. It was developed to help in any environments, not just government.

Then you have [PRINCE2](https://www.prince2.com/uk) (PRojects IN Controlled Environments) stuff which is a widely recognized project management methodology which was made in and for government in the 1980s and updated ever since. The PRINCE2 Practitioner qualification is the most well known.

A lot of big departments are moving away from PRINCE2 as it's a bit clunky and seen as outdated nowadays. APM qualifications tend to be cheaper and more practical. Such as the [APM Project Fundamentals Qualification](https://www.apm.org.uk/qualifications-and-training/project-management-fundamentals/)(PFQ) and the [Project Management Qualification](https://www.apm.org.uk/qualifications-and-training/project-management-qualification/) (PMQ)

**Key takeaway:** Association of Project Management (AMP) qualifications are more practical, cheap, and quicker to do in the modern Civil Service.

This ignores standalone random qualifications in [Agile](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-government-services-introduction), or whatever the newish [Government Campus](https://prospectus.governmentcampus.co.uk/02-project-delivery/) is pushing out for project delivery training and qualifications.
