Hi, I'm Naiyan. Or as most people call me, Nay.

I am a social researcher with a postgraduate diploma from the University of Birmingham. I am trained in both qualitative and quantative research methods. My specalisms are based in social media, government studies and public policy. I have experience working with charities, community groups, co-operatives and social work. 

My current research interest is on the social media website Reddit and learning to code. That includes this website!
