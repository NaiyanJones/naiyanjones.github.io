Hi, I'm Naiyan. Or as some people call me, Nay.

I am an analyst and researcher in the UK government. I have worked on and improved some of the largest surveys carried out in government by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). If you have heard news, or read an article, about inflation or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the past few years, then it's likley I worked on it. 

On the side I also have a wider interests including social media platforms and online communities. I have published internationally with several academics in North America on the social media platform Reddit.

Wider afield I have worked with charities, community groups, co-operatives and briefly in politics. I have a postgraduate diploma in social research from the University of Birmingham, UK.

I am a member of the [Social Research Association](https://the-sra.org.uk/), the [Association of Internet Researchers](https://aoir.org/) and the [University of Alabama Reddit Research Group](https://arrg.ua.edu/).
