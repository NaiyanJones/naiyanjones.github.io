Hi, I'm Naiyan. Or as most people call me, Nay.

I am an independent researcher and a data analyst at the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). My research interests include social media platform and online communities. I have a specific interest in the social media platform Reddit.

I have worked with charities, community groups, co-operatives and briefly in politics. I have a postgraduate diploma in social research from the University of Birmingham, UK.

Currently I am collaborating internationally with several American academics on papers involving the social media platform Reddit. These cover health topics, literature reviews, and digital research ethics. I also have a keen interest in building my skills on machine learning, particularly with natural language processing.

I am a member of the [Social Research Association](https://the-sra.org.uk/), the [Association of Internet Researchers](https://aoir.org/) and the [University of Alabama Reddit Research Group](https://arrg.ua.edu/).
